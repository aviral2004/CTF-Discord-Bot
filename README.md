#  How to Use
>This bot has commands for encoding/decoding, ciphers, and other commonly accessed tools during CTFs.  But, the main use for Werewolf.exe is to easily set up a CTF for your discord server to play as a team.  The following commands listed are probably going to be used the most.

* `>ctf create "ctf name"`  This is the command you'll use when you want to begin a new CTF.  This command will make a text channel with your supplied name under the category 'CTF' (If the category doesn't exist it will be created).  *Must have permissions to manage channels*

*NOTE: the following ctf specific commands will only be accepted under the channel created for that ctf.  This is to avoid clashes with multiple ctfs going on in the same server.*

 * `>ctf join/leave` Using this command will either give or remove the role of a created ctf to/from you.

 
 * `>ctf challenge add/working/solved/remove "challenge name"` Allows users to add or remove challenges to a list, and then set the status of that challenge. *Use quotations*
 
 * `>ctf challenge list` This is the list command that was previously mentioned, it displays the added challenges, who's working on what, and if a challenge is solved (and by who).

 > NOTE: There is shorthand!  challenge -> chal/chall, add -> a, working -> w, solved -> s, remove -> r

 * `>ctf end` Delete the ctf info from the db, and remove the role from your server.  *Must have permissions to manage channels*

---
>The following commands use the api from [ctftime](https://ctftime.org/api)

 * `>ctftime countdown/timeleft` Countdown will return when a selected CTF starts, and timeleft will return when any currently running CTFs end in the form of days hours minutes and seconds.

* `>ctftime upcoming <number>` Uses the api mentioned to return an embed up to 5 upcoming CTFs.  If no number is provided the default is 3.

* `>ctftime current` Displays any currently running CTFs in the same embed as previously mentioned.

* `>ctftime top <year>`  Shows the ctftime leaderboards from a certain year *(dates back to 2011)*.

* `>rot  "a message" <right/left>` Returns all 25 possible rotations for a message with an optional direction (defaults to left).

* `>b64 encode/decode "message"`  Encode or decode in base64 *(at the time of writing this, if there are any unprintable characters this command will not work, this goes for all encoding/decoding commands).*
